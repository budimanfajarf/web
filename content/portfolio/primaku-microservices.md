## About The Company

PT Cipta Medika Informasi (PrimaKu), an application that monitors children's health, exclusively collaborates with the Indonesian Pediatric Society (IDAI). Through this application, parents can easily and quickly access information about child development and health. PrimaKu also assists pediatricians in providing the best service by involving them in monitoring child development and health through separate application called PrimaPro.

## My Role & Responsibility

I work as a full-time Software Engineer (Backend) at PrimaKu. I have built some backend services from scratch and also contributed to existing backend services.

Below are some backend services I have contributed to while Iâ€™m working at PrimaKu:

### Core Application Service

Primary backend service for PrimaKu's application. There are various features I have work on in this service, the interesting one is for authentication. One day we decide to change 3rd party service for handle WhatsApp OTP to reduce our monthly costs, I entrusted to working on it.

The first thing I do is research and testing the 3rd party service APIs, to make sure this service is capable for our needs. In the development & integration process, I intensively communicate with the Customer Support (CS) when facing an issue. After completed the development & integration process, and then tested by our Quality Assurance (QA) team, we successfully migrate the WhatsApp OTP to the new 3rd party service and reduce our monthly costs.
