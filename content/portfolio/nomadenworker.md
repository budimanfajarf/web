## About The Project

Nomaden Worker is a website that helps you find your perfect workspace. It is a curated list of public spaces suitable for working, such as cafes, libraries, co-working spaces, and more. You can select your needs and preferences, such as seating type, facilities, ambience, and payment options, and the website will show you where you can find them. You can also see the latest updates, ratings, and reviews of each place. Nomaden Worker is a useful resource for remote workers, freelancers, students, and anyone who needs a change of scenery.

## The Problem

The old website was built with WordPress, the current system is not flexible and it's hard to maintain, and we want to upgrade the technology stacks for better performance. As result we decide to rebuild it with Laravel as CMS & RESTful API, and Next.js as Frontend.
