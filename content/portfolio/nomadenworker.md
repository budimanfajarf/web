## About The Project

Nomaden Worker is a website that helps you find your perfect workspace. It is a curated list of public spaces suitable for working, such as cafes, libraries, co-working spaces, and more. You can select your needs and preferences, such as seating type, facilities, ambience, and payment options, and the website will show you where you can find them. You can also see the latest updates, ratings, and reviews of each place. Nomaden Worker is a useful resource for remote workers, freelancers, students, and anyone who needs a change of scenery.

## The Problem

The old website was built with WordPress, the system is not flexible and it's hard to maintain. We want to upgrade the technology stacks for better performance, and want to rebuild the UI/UX as well for better user experience. As result we decide to rebuild it with Laravel as CMS & RESTful API, and Next.js as Frontend.

As we decided to rebuild the website, we still want to use the data from the old website, so we need to find some way to migrate the old data to the new one.

## My Role & Responsibility

1. Build the Frontend web and intergrate the RESTful API
