## About The Project

Brilianpreneur is an initiative organized by Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BRI), the largest bank in Indonesia. This annual event aims to empower and support Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in the country. BRI is committed to encouraging MSMEs to expand their presence on an international stage. In an era of globalization, it’s essential for MSMEs to keep up with evolving trends and establish connections with the global community.

## Main Features

1. MSMEs (Participants)

   MSME Showcase was held as the main program of UMKM EXPO(RT) BRILIANPRENEUR 2022. It presented products from over 500 selected MSMEs, as well as several art installations. The showcased products were rich in terms of variety, and were showcased under several zones according to their categories: Home Décor & Craft, Food & Beverage, Accessories & Beauty, Fashion & Wastra, Healthcare/Wellness, and Digital Technology (Startup).

1. Business Matching

   Business Matching is an activity where MSME entrepreneurs have the opportunity to meet potential partners or customers, in the hope of deals. UMKM EXPO(RT) BRILIANPRENEUR 2022 Business Matching attracted 43 buyers from 20 countries, with potential business deals amounting estimated USD 76 million.

1. Product Auctions

   The auction of the collaboration of designers and MSMEs was one of the UMKM EXPO(RT) BRILIANPRENEUR 2021 programs. The works of this collaborative were auctioned on brilianpreneur.com for 7 days. These 10 artworks were launched with an open bid price starting from Rp 1.000.000,- which then successfully obtained Rp 100.000.000,-. It was donated to the foundation whose mission is to nurture MSMEs, Sahabat UMKM.
