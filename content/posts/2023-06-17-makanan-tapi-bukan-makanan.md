<!--
What you listen to
What you look at
What you read
What you watch
What you talk about
All of this think about it as input
It's like food
That you're putting into your body, Right?
And so I ask people to imagine
Everytime you open your feed
Your feed meaning your feed wheter it on Facebook, Instagram, Twitter
Imagine then when you open your feed
It's like opening your fridge
That's what you're gonna eat that day
That's what you're in taking
And so that affects you
I need you understand that
You are not passive
Yo're not passively in taking
You're actively in taking those things
You're not just looking at it
I need you to understand
There's no such thing as "I'm just looking"
Whatever you look at
It's like you're swallowing it
It's like you're eating it
Because the eyes are a window to the heart
That's the way Allah designed it
You can't look at something without it affecting your heart

Ketika membuka _feed_ sosial media, entah itu _facebook_, _instagram_, _tiktok_, dll.
Bayangkan kalo itu seperti kita membuka kulkas, itulah hal-hal yang akan kita "makan" hari itu, itulah yang akan kita konsumsi, dan itu akan mempengaruhi kita.

Kita tidak pasif, kita aktif dalam mengkonsumsi hal-hal tersebut, kita tidak "hanya melihatnya", ini seperti kita memakannya.

Karena mata adalah jendela hati, kita tidak bisa melihat sesuatu tanpa mempengaruhi hati kita.
