## - Me

Hi! My name is Budiman Fajar Firdaus, I'm a Backend Developer from Bandung, Indonesia :)

I have been 5 years in IT stuff and have been focused on web development for 3 years. I love to code, and more prefer to code in the backend, but I can do frontend too.

Here my experience in some languages and frameworks, both in backend and frontend: [PHP](https://www.php.net/ "PHP"), [Laravel](https://laravel.com/ "Laravel"), [CodeIgniter](https://codeigniter.com/ "CodeIgniter"), [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript "JavaScript"), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/ "Node.js"), [Express.js](http://expressjs.com/ "Express.js"), [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/ "Vue.js"), [React.js](https://reactjs.org/ "React.js"), [Hugo](https://gohugo.io "Hugo").

## - Blog

[budidev.com](/ "Base URL") is my personal blog about coding and web development especially in backend development, but sometimes I write outside those topics.

It's created using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io "Hugo") with customized [Hermit](https://themes.gohugo.io/hermit "Hugo Hermit theme") theme. You can see the source code in [Github](https://github.com/budimanfajarf/blog "Github Blog Budiman Fajar Firdaus").
